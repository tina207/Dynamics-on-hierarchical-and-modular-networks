# Dynamics-on-hierarchical-and-modular-networks

## Main features:
- create Erdos-Renyi graphs, random hierarchical and modular networks, centralized hierarchical and modular networks
- simulate dynamics on given networks or oscillators 



## Abstract:
In this project, we will study how the macroscopic state of hierarchical and modular networks depends on the dynamics of single modules, and how this is shaped by the proximity of criticality.
This is interesting to know since part of the theoretical understanding of brain dynamics at a large scale comes from the simulation of dynamic models in a structural network.
However, the influence of the topology of the connectome on dynamics is still an open question.
Whole-brain dynamics suggest that certain brain regions can operate near a transition between asynchronous and synchronous regimes, which would entail functional benefits such as maximum dynamic range and high sensitivity to stimuli.
We start by analyzing single oscillators first, and then a network of excitable oscillators for its dynamics. How dynamics display in whole networks gives insight into the functional diversity of the brain.
